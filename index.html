			<h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
			<p>Hi. I'm Averyx, at least that's my online alias, I will never reveal my face or name on the internet. Only thing you can know is I'm thirteen and in my freshman 			year of high school. Cool. Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading this blog. I have rants (about teachers, friends, etc.), thoughts(deep thinking), and puzzles & paradoxes.</p>
